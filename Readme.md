The purpose of my website is to display my professional development and character online for potential employers to get a grasp of my capabilities when considering me for future employment. 

The website links between four pages, consisting of a home page, my biography, a page displaying my coding skillset and a 'contact me' page where people can get in touch with me through a contact form via Netlify.

The website is very easy to navigate, with buttons to each of the other three pages available on each page.

I planned out my path initially on figma, drawing out complimenting colours and deciding on the fonts I was going to take forward.

Alongside Figma I used Trello to plan my step by step process to bring the website together.

## Question 1:
Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today.

- In 1966, ARPANET was founded, a military system used for sending data across long distances and proved influencial in the eventual creation of the internet. This paved the way for the influencial paper 'A Protocol for Packet Network Interconnection', a precurser to the packet switching methods used to exchange data between computers.

- UCLA and Stanford in the USA were connected and in 1983 moved over to the TCP/IP system giving rise to the modern day world wide web.

- In 1990 a British CERN employee by the name of Tim Berners-Lee chose to investigate a more efficient method of exchanging information and began the process of creating and exchanging hypertext, giving birth to the web.

- In 1993 Marc Andreessen and colleagues at University of Illinois create the first web browser, Mosaic, allowing the public to view words and images on screen together for the first time. 


## Question 2:
Define and describe the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers.

- A web domain is an actual presence on the Internet, which could be a website, the computer hosting the website or a personal computer accessing that website. Web servers act as hosts to these domains and website files in general, storing data ready to be called by the public when required. 

- Given the gigantic nature of the modern day internet, managing addresses for internet traffic needs to be efficient. The DNS (Domain Name System) facilitates this process, linking readable URL addresses with IP address which internet addresses are based on, allowing the public to surf the internet to reach the information they need.

- Web browsers provide the entry point for the public to do just that. Browsers act as as easy to understand search points for people to find what they need. Search queries are translated eventually into IP addresses which allow the public to reach the information they need.



##Question 3:
Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today.

- One of the largest impacts the internet has had has been the effect on purchases. Online purchases has grown exponentially over a few short decades and now online sellers count themselves amongst the worlds most powerful companies.

- Amazon has risen to become one of the largest companies in the world while it's CEO Jeff Bezos is officially the world's richest man.

- While shopping online is fast and efficient, allowing companies to lower prices, online shopping has brought negatives, including a rise in fraud and the squeezing of small, independent, traditional sellers and placing the odds in favour of large corporations.

- Alongside purchases, the internet has allowed for a new and unparalleled wave of targeted advertising. Stores are able to track customers interests more closely then ever while social media has allowed for customer shopping data to become a viable commodity in itself.
